# Pantry Chef

A Discord bot for The Pantry community, built with discord.js and TypeScript.

## Set up

1. Install dependencies with `pnpm install`.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your bot token, application ID, and Gemini AI API key.
3. During development, set `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` so command updates deploy to one server quickly.
4. Run `pnpm commands:deploy` whenever a command definition changes.
5. Run `pnpm dev` to start the bot with Node's watch mode.

Use `pnpm start` outside development and `pnpm check` to run formatting and type-aware linting
checks.

## Adding a command

Add a `.ts` file one level below `src/commands`, such as `src/commands/general/ping.ts`, and
default-export a command created with `defineCommand` from `#/lib/commands.ts`. Command modules are
discovered automatically when the bot starts and when commands are deployed, so no registry import
needs to be updated manually. The immediate folder name is the command's category and is displayed
in uppercase by `/help`.

Keep support code outside `src/commands`: every TypeScript file directly inside a category folder is
treated as a command module. Nested category folders are not scanned.

## Reaction roles

Replace the channel and role ID placeholders in
`src/features/reaction-roles/config.ts`, then deploy the commands and run
`/reaction-roles`. The command creates one managed message per enabled panel and updates those
same messages on future runs.

The bot requires View Channel, Send Messages, Embed Links, Read Message History, Add Reactions, and
Manage Roles in the configured channel. Its highest role must be above every role it assigns.

`/embed create` creates a simple markdown-enabled embed. `/embed edit` edits an embed in the current
channel by default; select the optional channel argument when the message is elsewhere.

## Server information

Replace the channel ID placeholder and edit the markdown in `src/features/server-info/config.ts`,
then run `/server-info`. The command creates the managed server info embed or updates the
existing one when the hardcoded markdown changes.
